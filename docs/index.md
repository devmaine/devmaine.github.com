# Good News

The message about Jesus is good news to everyone.

## Good News: God Loves Everyone

How do we know that God loves everyone? God showed his love for us because even though we have all broken God's law, Jesus died for us.

## Good News: We Can All be Forgiven

No matter what we may have done wrong, we can have a do over. Forgivness is a free gift made possible by the death of Jesus.

## Good News: Jesus is Alive

This is good news because Jesus has done what no one else has ever done, he came back from the dead by his own power. If he is able to raise himself, he is able to raise others from the dead and to give them eternal life.

## Good News: God's Gifts are Free

The only thing you need to do is to turn to God and trust in Jesus and you can have eternal life.
